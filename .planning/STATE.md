## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-Phase 2: Must decide `gpg.program` installation UX (shell wrapper vs. symlink dispatch) before Phase 2 implementation starts — research recommends shell wrapper as simpler

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: `gpg.program` installation UX decision (shell wrapper vs. symlink) must be resolved before plan-phase runs — not complex but must be explicit
- Phase 2: Confirm worktree behavior (`GIT_DIR` + `GIT_WORK_TREE`) for changed-files collection via `git diff --cached` in worktree contexts
